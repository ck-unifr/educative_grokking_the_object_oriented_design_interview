    "## Object-Oriented Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming that focuses on using objects to design and build applications. Contrary to procedure-oriented programming where programs are designed as blocks of statements to manipulate data, OOP organizes the program to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an “Object”.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have never used an object-oriented programming language before, you will need to learn a few basic concepts before you can begin writing any code. This chapter will introduce some basic concepts of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects: Objects represent a real-world entity and the basic building block of OOP. For example, an Online Shopping System will have objects such as shopping cart, customer, product item, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class: Class is the prototype or blueprint of an object. It is a template definition of the attributes and methods of an object. For example, in the Online Shopping System, the Customer object will have attributes like shipping address, credit card, etc., and methods for placing an order, canceling an order, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the mechanism of binding the data together and hiding it from the outside world. Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private so that other objects don’t have direct access to its state. Instead, they can access this state only through a set of public functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction can be thought of as the natural extension of encapsulation. It means hiding all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce the complexity of the system. In a large system, objects talk to each other, which makes it difficult to maintain a large code base; abstraction helps by hiding internal implementation details of objects and only revealing operations that are relevant to other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism of creating new classes from existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism (from Greek, meaning “many forms”) is the ability of an object to take different forms and thus, depending upon the context, to respond to the same message in different ways. Take the example of a chess game; a chess piece can take many forms, like bishop, castle, or knight and all these pieces will respond differently to the ‘move’ message.\n",

    "## OO Analysis and Design\n",
    "OO Analysis and Design is a structured method for analyzing and designing a system by applying object-oriented concepts. This design process consists of an investigation into the objects constituting the system. It starts by first identifying the objects of the system and then figuring out the interactions between various objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of OO analysis and design can be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying the objects in a system;\n",
    "- Defining relationships between objects;\n",
    "- Establishing the interface of each object; and,\n",
    "- Making a design, which can be converted to executables using OO languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a standard method/tool to document all this information; for this purpose we use UML. UML can be considered as the successor of object-oriented (OO) analysis and design. UML is powerful enough to represent all the concepts that exist in object-oriented analysis and design. UML diagrams are a representation of object-oriented concepts only. Thus, before learning UML, it is essential to understand OO concepts.\n",

    "## What is UML?\n",
    "\n",
    "UML stands for Unified Modeling Language and is used to model the Object-Oriented Analysis of a software system. UML is a way of visualizing and documenting a software system by using a collection of diagrams, which helps engineers, businesspeople, and system architects understand the behavior and structure of the system being designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of using UML:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps develop a quick understanding of a software system.\n",
    "- UML modeling helps in breaking a complex system into discrete pieces that can be easily understood.\n",
    "- UML’s graphical notations can be used to communicate design decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since UML is independent of any specific platform or language or technology, it is easier to abstract out concepts.\n",
    "It becomes easier to hand the system over to a new team.\n",

    "Types of UML Diagrams: The current UML standards call for 14 different kinds of diagrams. These diagrams are organized into two distinct groups: structural diagrams and behavioral or interaction diagrams. As the names suggest, some UML diagrams analyze and depict the structure of a system or process, whereas others describe the behavior of the system, its actors, and its building components. The different types are broken down as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural UML diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class diagram\n",
    "- Object diagram\n",
    "- Package diagram\n",
    "- Component diagram\n",
    "- Composite structure diagram\n",
    "- Deployment diagram\n",
    "- Profile diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioral UML diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use case diagram\n",
    "- Activity diagram\n",
    "- Sequence diagram\n",
    "- State diagram\n",
    "- Communication diagram\n",
    "- Interaction overview diagram\n",
    "- Timing diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will be focusing on the following UML diagrams:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case Diagram: Used to describe a set of user scenarios, this diagram, illustrates the functionality provided by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class Diagram: Used to describe structure and behavior in the use cases, this diagram provides a conceptual model of the system in terms of entities and their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activity Diagram: Used to model the functional flow-of-control between two or more class objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequence Diagram: Used to describe interactions among classes in terms of an exchange of messages over time.\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Use Case Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "Use case diagrams describe a set of actions (called use cases) that a system should or can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system (called actors). Each use case should provide some observable and valuable result to the actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case Diagrams describe the high-level functional behavior of the system.\n",
    "- It answers what system does from the user point of view.\n",
    "- Use case answers ‘What will the system do?’ and at the same time tells us ‘What will the system NOT do?’.\n",
    "\n",
    "A use case illustrates a unit of functionality provided by the system. The primary purpose of the use case diagram is to help development teams visualize the functional requirements of a system, including the relationship of “actors” to the essential processes, as well as the relationships among different use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate a use case on a use case diagram, we draw an oval in the middle of the diagram and put the name of the use case in the center of the oval. To show an actor (indicating a system user) on a use-case diagram, we draw a stick figure to the left or right of the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The different components of the use case diagram are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- System boundary: A system boundary defines the scope and limits of the system. It is shown as a rectangle that spans all use cases of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actors: An actor is an entity who performs specific actions. These roles are the actual business roles of the users in a given system. An actor interacts with a use case of the system. For example, in a banking system, the customer is one of the actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Case: Every business functionality is a potential use case. The use case should list the discrete business functionality specified in the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include: Include relationship represents an invocation of one use case by another use case. From a coding perspective, it is like one function being called by another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extend: This relationship signifies that the extended use case will work exactly like the base use case, except that some new steps will be inserted in the extended use case.\n",

    "## Class Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Class diagram is the backbone of object-oriented modeling - it shows how different entities (people, things, and data) relate to each other. In other words, it shows the static structures of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class diagram describes the attributes and operations of a class and also the constraints imposed on the system. Class diagrams are widely used in the modeling of object-oriented systems because they are the only UML diagrams that can be mapped directly to object-oriented languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the class diagram can be summarized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analysis and design of the static view of an application;\n",
    "- To describe the responsibilities of a system;\n",
    "- To provide a base for component and deployment diagrams; and,\n",
    "- Forward and reverse engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is depicted in the class diagram as a rectangle with three horizontal sections, as shown in the figure below. The upper section shows the class’s name (Flight), the middle section contains the properties of the class, and the lower section contains the class’s operations (or “methods”).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the different types of relationships between classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Association: If two classes in a model need to communicate with each other, there must be a link between them. This link can be represented by an association. Associations can be represented in a class diagram by a line between these classes with an arrow indicating the navigation direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, associations are always assumed to be bi-directional; this means that both classes are aware of each other and their relationship. In the diagram below, the association between Pilot and FlightInstance is bi-directional, as both classes know each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By contrast, in a uni-directional association, two classes are related - but only one class knows that the relationship exists. In the below example, only Flight class knows about Aircraft; hence it is a uni-directional association\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplicity Multiplicity indicates how many instances of a class participate in the relationship. It is a constraint that specifies the range of permitted cardinalities between two classes. For example, in the diagram below, one FlightInstance will have two Pilots, while a Pilot can have many FlightInstances. A ranged multiplicity can be expressed as “0…*” which means “zero to many\" or as “2…4” which means “two to four”.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can indicate the multiplicity of an association by adding multiplicity adornments to the line denoting the association. The below diagram, demonstrates that a FlightInstance has exactly two Pilots but a Pilot can have many FlightInstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: Aggregation is a special type of association used to model a “whole to its parts” relationship. In a basic aggregation relationship, the lifecycle of a PART class is independent of the WHOLE class’s lifecycle. In other words, aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. In the above diagram, Aircraft can exist without Airline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition: The composition aggregation relationship is just another form of the aggregation relationship, but the child class’s instance lifecycle is dependent on the parent class’s instance lifecycle. In other words, Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. In the above example, WeeklySchedule is composed in Flight which means when Flight lifecycle ends, WeeklySchedule automatically gets destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalization: Generalization is the mechanism for combining similar classes of objects into a single, more general class. Generalization identifies commonalities among a set of entities. In the above diagram, Crew, Pilot, and Admin, all are Person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency: A dependency relationship is a relationship in which one class, the client, uses or depends on another class, the supplier. In the above diagram, FlightReservation depends on Payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract class: An abstract class is identified by specifying its name in italics. In the above diagram, both Person and Account classes are abstract classes.\n",

    "## Sequence diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence diagrams describe interactions among classes in terms of an exchange of messages over time and are used to explore the logic of complex operations, functions or procedures. In this diagram, the sequence of interactions between the objects is represented in a step-by-step manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence diagrams show a detailed flow for a specific use case or even just part of a particular use case. They are almost self-explanatory; they show the calls between the different objects in their sequence and can explain, at a detailed level, different calls to various objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence diagram has two dimensions: The vertical dimension shows the sequence of messages in the chronological order that they occur; the horizontal dimension shows the object instances to which the messages are sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence diagram is straightforward to draw. Across the top of your diagram, identify the class instances (objects) by putting each class instance inside a box (see above figure). If a class instance sends a message to another class instance, draw a line with an open arrowhead pointing to the receiving class instance and place the name of the message above the line. Optionally, for important messages, you can draw a dotted line with an arrowhead pointing back to the originating class instance; label the returned value above the dotted line.\n"

An activity diagram shows the flow of control for a system functionality; it emphasizes the condition of flow and the sequence in which it happens. We can also use an activity diagram to refer to the steps involved in the execution of a use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activity diagrams illustrate the dynamic nature of a system by modeling the flow of control from activity to activity. An activity represents an operation on some class in the system that results in a change in the state of the system. Typically, activity diagrams are used to model workflow or business processes and internal operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "A Library Management System is a software built to handle the primary housekeeping functions of a library. Libraries rely on library management systems to manage asset collections as well as relationships with their members. Library management systems help libraries keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well as members’ subscriptions and profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Library management systems also involve maintaining the database for entering new books and recording books that have been borrowed with their respective due dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "💡     Always clarify requirements at the beginning of the interview. Be sure to ask questions to find the exact scope of the system that the interviewer has in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the Library Management System:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any library member should be able to search books by their title, author, subject category as well by the publication date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each book will have a unique identification number and other details including a rack number which will help to physically locate the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There could be more than one copy of a book, and library members should be able to check-out and reserve any copy. We will call each copy of a book, a book item.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system should be able to retrieve information like who took a particular book or what are the books checked-out by a specific library member.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There should be a maximum limit (5) on how many books a member can check-out.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There should be a maximum limit (10) on how many days a member can keep a book.\n",
    "\n",

    "- The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reserved books become available, as well as when the book is not returned within the due date.\n",

    "## Design a Parking Lot\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A parking lot or car park is a dedicated cleared area that is intended for parking vehicles. In most countries where cars are a major mode of transportation, parking lots are a feature of every city and suburban area. Shopping malls, sports stadiums, megachurches, and similar venues often feature parking lots over large areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the parking lot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The parking lot should have multiple floors where customers can park their cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The parking lot should have multiple entry and exit points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customers can collect a parking ticket from the entry points and can pay the parking fee at the exit points on their way out.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customers can pay the tickets at the automated exit panel or to the parking attendant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customers can pay via both cash and credit cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customers should also be able to pay the parking fee at the customer’s info portal on each floor. If the customer has paid at the info portal, they don’t have to pay at the exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system should not allow more vehicles than the maximum capacity of the parking lot. If the parking is full, the system should be able to show a message at the entrance panel and on the parking display board on the ground floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each parking floor will have many parking spots. The system should support multiple types of parking spots such as Compact, Large, Handicapped, Motorcycle, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Parking lot should have some parking spots specified for electric cars. These spots should have an electric panel through which customers can pay and charge their vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system should support parking for different types of vehicles like car, truck, van, motorcycle, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each parking floor should have a display board showing any free parking spot for each spot type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system should support a per-hour parking fee model. For example, customers have to pay $4 for the first hour, $3.5 for the second and third hours, and $2.5 for all the remaining hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use case diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main Actors in our system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Admin: Mainly responsible for adding and modifying parking floors, parking spots, entrance, and exit panels, adding/removing parking attendants, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer: All customers can get a parking ticket and pay for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parking attendant: Parking attendants can do all the activities on the customer’s behalf, and can take cash for ticket payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- System: To display messages on different info panels, as well as assigning and removing a vehicle from a parking spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the top use cases for Parking Lot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add/Remove/Edit parking floor: To add, remove or modify a parking floor from the system. Each floor can have its own display board to show free parking spots.\n",
    "- Add/Remove/Edit parking spot: To add, remove or modify a parking spot on a parking floor.\n",
    "- Add/Remove a parking attendant: To add or remove a parking attendant from the system.\n",
    "- Take ticket: To provide customers with a new parking ticket when entering the parking lot.\n",
    "- Scan ticket: To scan a ticket to find out the total charge.\n",
    "- Credit card payment: To pay the ticket fee with credit card.\n",
    "- Cash payment: To pay the parking ticket through cash.\n",
    "- Add/Modify parking rate: To allow admin to add or modify the hourly parking rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main classes of our Parking Lot System:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ParkingLot: The central part of the organization for which this software has been designed. It has attributes like ‘Name’ to distinguish it from any other parking lots and ‘Address’ to define its location.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ParkingFloor: The parking lot will have many parking floors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ParkingSpot: Each parking floor will have many parking spots. Our system will support different parking spots 1) Handicapped, 2) Compact, 3) Large, 4) Motorcycle, and 5) Electric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Account: We will have two types of accounts in the system: one for an Admin, and the other for a parking attendant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parking ticket: This class will encapsulate a parking ticket. Customers will take a ticket when they enter the parking lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vehicle: Vehicles will be parked in the parking spots. Our system will support different types of vehicles 1) Car, 2) Truck, 3) Electric, 4) Van and 5) Motorcycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- EntrancePanel and ExitPanel: EntrancePanel will print tickets, and ExitPanel will facilitate payment of the ticket fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Payment: This class will be responsible for making payments. The system will support credit card and cash transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ParkingRate: This class will keep track of the hourly parking rates. It will specify a dollar amount for each hour. For example, for a two hour parking ticket, this class will define the cost for the first and the second hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ParkingDisplayBoard: Each parking floor will have a display board to show available parking spots for each spot type. This class will be responsible for displaying the latest availability of free parking spots to the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ParkingAttendantPortal: This class will encapsulate all the operations that an attendant can perform, like scanning tickets and processing payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CustomerInfoPortal: This class will encapsulate the info portal that customers use to pay for the parking ticket. Once paid, the info portal will update the ticket to keep track of the payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ElectricPanel: Customers will use the electric panels to pay and charge their electric vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
